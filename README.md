# Rohrschachts dotfiles
My configuration file repository started out as a fork of [avivace/dotfiles](https://github.com/avivace/dotfiles). avivace did a great job of combining i3 and KDE Plasma in his configuration. I was eager to try this out as I loved both KDE and i3 at the time.

This repository has strayed quite a bit from [avivace/dotfiles](https://github.com/avivace/dotfiles) since the fork. I don't use i3 and some other software anymore. I rewrote some configs completely to fit my liking. For this reason I created this new branch to get rid of some old stuff. I currently use dwm as my window manager. I still use it in conjunction with KDE Plasma. My dwm build can be found [here](https://github.com/Rohrschacht/dwm).

The original fork can still be found at the master branch.
